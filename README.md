# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is an interactive Tic Tac Toe game built with customizable player symbols and a score-tracking system. You can play with default symbols "X" and "O" or choose your own symbols before starting the game. The game tracks the score after each round, encouraging friendly competition between two players.

### Live Demo

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend in this classic two-player game.
- **Symbol Selection**: Players can choose their own symbols before the game begins. If no symbols are selected, the default "X" and "O" will be used.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of each player's score. Every time a player wins, their score is updated.
- **New Game After Each Round**: After each round, players can reset the game board and continue playing while retaining their scores.
